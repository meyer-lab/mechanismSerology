## Results

### Systems serology measurements can be drastically reduced without loss of information

![**TMTF improves data reduction of systems serology measurements.** A) Percent variance reconstructed (R2X) versus the number of components used in TMTF decomposition. B) TMTF reconstruction error compared to PCA versus the size of the resulting factorization. The unexplained variance is normalized to the starting variance.](figure0.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:compress width="100%"}

### Factorization accurately imputes missing values

![**Systems serology measurements contain a small number of consistent patterns across their measurements.** Percent variance predicted (Q2X) versus the number of components used for imputation of held out receptor-ligand pairs.](figure1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:impute width="100%"}

### Factor components represent consistent patterns in the HIV humoral immune response

![**Factor components represent consistent patterns in the HIV humoral immune response.** Decomposed components along subjects (A), receptors (B), antigens (C), and glycans (D). All plots are shown on a common color scale.](figure2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:factors width="100%"}
